# ####### -> row for only walls
# #0#0#0# -> row for alternating wall and tile
# ####### -> row for only walls
# #0#0#0# -> row for alternating wall and tile
# ####### -> row for only walls
# To change the maze layout, edit the walls to 0s.
# the position of tile and wall is fixed. Only the walls can be removed.
# but if the tile has different number other than 0 it means there is an trap with that id.
# the trap are drawn in Drawings.py with the function draw_<trap_id>
# there are 3 traps for now with id 2,3,4
# 2 -> spike trap
# 3 -> fire trap
# 4 -> saw trap
